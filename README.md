2.	Initialize Git Repository
•	Open the integrated terminal (`Ctrl+``) and navigate to your project directory using:
cd path/to/your/project
•	Initialize a new Git repository using “git init” that initializes Git in your project directory, setting it up for version control. 

Making Commits
3.	Add and Commit Changes
•	Add all changes  and commit them using the dot (.) to stage all files. Enter a commit message in the textbox at the top of the Source Control view. Use the following:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Pushing changes to GitHub
4.	Push Changes to GitHub
If you want to push changes to a remote repository on GitHub:
•	Ensure you have a GitHub repository created.
•	Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL of your GitHub repository.
•	In the integrated terminal in VS Code, add the remote repository URL as origin.:
git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>

Push changes to GitHub
Ensure you replace main with your branch name if it differs. If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password to authenticate the push: 
git push -u origin main
